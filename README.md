# Deloitte .NET COP React "Tour of Heroes" Workshop.

This workshop will introduce fundamental concepts and techniques for building React applications. The Tour of Heroes app demonstrates how to load and display a list of heroes, add heroes, edit hero details, and navigate between each view.

By the end of this workshop you will have an understanding of:
- JSX syntax
- React class components and functional components
- Event handling
- State management
- React hooks

## Prerequisites

This workshop assumes a basic understanding of JavaScript and HTML as well as familiarity with JavaScript ES6 features such as const, let, classes, and arrow functions. If you need a refresher on JavaScript you can run through this [tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) to get up to speed.

## Setup

1. Install a recent version of [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org).
2. Make a new project using [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app)
```
npx create-react-app react-tour-of-heroes
```

## Contents
- [Create the Project](docs/0-create-project.md)
- [Part 1: The Hero Editor](docs/1-the-hero-editor.md)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
